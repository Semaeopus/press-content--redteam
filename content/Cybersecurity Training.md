Although _Off Grid: Red Team_ is, at its core, a video game, it was purposefully designed to provide players with hands-on cybersecurity training.

**Developed in collaboration with cybersecurity professionals**, the game replicates real-world scenarios while maintaining an engaging, game-first experience.

During our initial testing phase, untrained players were able to progress using real websites and techniques, showcasing the game's authentic approach. By the end of their playthrough, they had a stronger understanding of common security risksâ€”and how even simple precautions can significantly improve the protection of personal or professional data.
